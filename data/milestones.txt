MILESTONE 1 ATC Flight Plan Activated	

Definition The ICAO flight plan is submitted to ATC. The Airport CDM Platform is initiated for this flight, 
and all available information is processed.

Origin and priority The ATC Flight Plan is submitted by the Aircraft Operator and distributed by the IFPS. All 
involved ATC units receive the flight plan, including departure and destination aerodromes.

Timing Normally this takes place 3 hours before EOBT, however it may be later. In some cases a 
repetitive flight plan (RFPL) has been submitted, covering daily or weekly flights.

Data Quality The ATC Flight Plan corresponds to the airport slot programme.

Effect One aircraft turn-round normally includes an arriving and a departing flight, meaning that 
it will have two related flight plans. For coordinated airports, the outbound flight is already 
known. The flight plan may be used to update certain information such as type of aircraft. 
For long distance flights, the ELDT may differ from the airport slot. For non coordinated 
airports, the flight plan is used to initiate the outbound flight. The flight is ready not later than 
15 minutes after the planned EOBT. The DPI process commences the correct messaging 
with Network Operations (if implemented – see attachment 2 for details).

Procedures To check consistency between ATC Flight Plan, Airport Slot and Airport flight data and 
then confirm the flight to the Network Operations and allow further local processing of 
the flight.

This check shall be performed to verify the consistency between the ATC Flight Plan, Airport 
Slot and Airport flight data before the first E-DPI is sent. The AO must provide correct infor-
mation before this first E-DPI message, in order to feed Network Operations with consistent 
SOBT, aircraft registration, and first destination data, as early in time as possible. The E-DPI 
message should not be sent if no or inconsistent information is provided.

This process is triggered by:
n	 The first activation of the ATC Flight Plan (earliest EOBT-3 hr), or
n	 New or late submissions of the ATC Flight Plan, after cancellation or revised EOBT

MILESTONE 2 EOBT - 2 hr

Definition At EOBT-2 hr most flights will be known in the Airport CDM Platform including if they are regu-
lated or not. All regulated flights receive a CTOT from Network Operations.

Origin and priority The CTOT is issued by the Network Operations and is sent to relevant ATS units as well as the 
departure aerodrome. CTOT flights usually have a priority over unregulated flights.

Timing If the flight is regulated, a CTOT is issued at EOBT–2h.	

Data Quality Not applicable.

Effect For inbound flights, ELDT is updated based on information provided by the FUM messages, 
taking into account the actual progress of the flight. 					

Procedures To check (before or after take off from outstation) whether AO/GH flight estimates are consist-
ent with the ATC Flight Plan and to inform Network Operations about the updated take off 
time estimate, using a T-DPI Message.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan estimated off block 
time at EOBT-2 hrs. At EOBT-2 hrs Network Operations is informed through the first T-DPI 
message. Calculation basis for the TTOT shall take into account EIBT+MTTT+EXOT, if lat-
er than EOBT+EXOT. In the case of manual input of TOBT, this estimate will override the 
EIBT+MTTT estimate, hence TTOT equals TOBT+EXOT.

This procedure is triggered by 
n     a time stamp, at EOBT – 2h.

MILESTONE 3 Take Off from Outstation

Definition The ATOT from the outstation (ADEP)

Origin and priority The outstation provides ATOT to the Network Operations and Aircraft Operator.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality The accuracy of ATOT is +/- 1 minute.

Effect If the departure airport is more than 3hrs flying time from the destination airport the ATOT 
is received from either the Network Operations FUM or via the Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler. Using the ATOT an ELDT can be calculated by using the Estimated Elapsed Time 
on the FPL. 

If the flight is within 3hrs flying time of the destination airport the Network Operations moni-
tors progress of the flight using the ETFMS and send a Flight Update Message (FUM) that 
provides updates of the flight’s progress. 

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH estimated landing time after take off from outstation are con-
sistent with the outbound ATC Flight Plan, and when needed inform the Network Operations 
about the updated take off time estimates using a T-DPI-t Message. 

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan at take off from outsta-
tion. A TTOT tolerance of 5 minutes is respected before Network Operations is informed of 
the updated TTOT. Calculation basis for the TTOT shall take into account EIBT+MTTT+EXOT. 
In case EOBT is later than EIBT+MTTT, TTOT equals EOBT+EXOT. In the case where 
TOBT is available this prediction will overrule the EIBT+MTTT estimate, hence TTOT equals 
TOBT+EXOT.

This process is triggered by
n    the take off from outstation.

MILESTONE 4 Local Radar Update

Definition The flight enters the FIR (Flight Information Region) or the local airspace of the destina-
tion airport.

Origin and priority This information is normally available from the Area Control Centre (ACC) or Approach Con-
trol Unit that is associated with an airport. The radar system is able to detect a flight based 
upon the assigned SSR code when the flight crosses a defined FIR/ATC boundary.

Timing Dependent upon the position of the airport in relation to the FIR boundary.

Data Quality Must be equal to the accuracy of the ATC system.

Effect Update of the ELDT can trigger a new TOBT to be entered by the AO/GH, or calculated 
automatically by the Airport CDM Platform. The accuracy of ELDT is particularly impor-
tant at this stage since downstream decisions are taken, such as stand /gate / aircraft 
changes, preparation of arrival sequence, preparation of ground handling operations, 
decisions for connecting passengers.

Uncertainty and ELDT non-accuracy at this stage significantly increase risks for bad and 
last minute decisions and internal disruptions. The objective to decrease the number of 
stand and gate changes in the last 30 minutes requires high accuracy regarding depar-
ture and arrival times. Therefore, taking into account the taxi-in time (EXIT), any change 
to a stand or gate is not preferred after ELDT-30’.

The update of TOBT for the related departing flight takes place following this milestone. 
Decisions such as the turn-round period, connecting passengers etc are taken and 
need to be stable at this event. An estimated in-block time (EIBT) is computed using the 
ELDT and the estimated taxi-in time.

Procedures To commence the TOBT process and check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent 
with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Operations is informed when the TTOT changes by 
more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the up-
dated TOBT. The TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations is informed 
of updated TTOT.

This process is triggered by
n   the detection of the flight by radar in either FIR, TMA, or on Final Approach.

MILESTONE 5 Final Approach	

Definition The flight enters the Final Approach phase at the destination airport.

Origin and priority This information is normally available from ATC. The radar system detects a flight based 
upon the assigned SSR code and identifies when the flight crosses either a defined 
range / position or passes/leaves a predetermined level.

Timing Dependent upon local parameters that are defined by ATC.

Data Quality Must be equal to the accuracy of the ATC system.

Effect Update of the ELDT to determine a new TOBT. When a flight reaches this stage it is usu-
ally between 2 and 5 minutes from landing (depending on the parameter set by ATC). 
This is often the prompt for many partners to start moving resources connected with the 
flight, such as positioning a parking marshal and ground handling services.

Procedures To commence the TOBT process and check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent 
with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Operations is informed when the TTOT changes by 
more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the up-
dated TOBT. The TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations is informed 
of updated TTOT.

This process is triggered by

MILESTONE 6 Landed

Definition ALDT – Actual Landing Time. This is the time that an aircraft touches down on a runway. 
(Equivalent to ATC ATA – Actual Time of Arrival landing, ACARS=ON).

Origin and priority Provided by ATC system or by ACARS from equipped aircraft.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect The occurrence of ALDT triggers an update of downstream estimates: TOBT and TTOT 
are updated automatically or inserted manually by the Aircraft Operator / Ground Han-
dler, calculated on the basis of the defined turn-round period for the departing flight.

The EIBT can be updated according to the ALDT +EXIT.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Op-
erations is informed when the TTOT changes by more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the updat-
ed TOBT or ATC Flight Plan. A TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations 
is informed on updated TTOT.

MILESTONE 7 In-Block	

Definition AIBT - Actual In-Block Time. This is the time that an aircraft arrives in-blocks.
(Equivalent to Airline/Handler ATA – Actual Time of Arrival, ACARS = IN)

Note: ACGT is considered to commence at AIBT

Origin and priority ACARS equipped aircraft or automated docking systems or ATC systems 
(e.g. A-SMGCS) or by manual input.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect The occurrence of AIBT should trigger an update of downstream estimates: TOBT and 
TTOT are updated automatically or inserted manually by the Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler, calculated on the basis of the estimated turn-round period for the departing 
flight.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Op-
erations is informed when the TTOT changes by more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the updat-
ed TOBT or ATC Flight Plan. A TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations

MILESTONE 8 Ground Handling Started	

Definition Commence of Ground Handling Operations (ACGT).

Note: this milestone is specific to flights that are the first operation of the day or that have 
been long term parked. For flights that are on a normal turn-round ACGT is considered 
to commence at AIBT.

Origin and priority Aircraft Operator / Ground Handler will provide the information.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect The occurrence of ACGT triggers an update of downstream estimates:
TOBT is updated automatically or inserted manually by the Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler, calculated on the basis of the estimated turn-round period for the departing 
flight.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Op-

MILESTONE 9 Final Confirmation of the TOBT

Definition The time at which the Aircraft Operator or Ground Handler provide their most accurate 
TOBT taking into account the operational situation.

Origin and priority The Aircraft Operator / Ground Handler provides the information.

Timing The information is provided t minutes before EOBT
(t is a parameter time agreed locally).

Data Quality Accuracy is agreed locally.

Effect The aim of the final TOBT is to give a timely, accurate and reliable assessment of the off-
block time. It is recognised that main benefits of sharing the TOBT are expected in case of 
disruptions (internal or external). In such cases, the difference between EOBT (shared by 
ATC, Network Operations and Stand / Gate Management) and TOBT may be important.

An accurate TOBT at [EOBT-t minutes] is a pre-requisite for ATC to establish a push back / 
pre-departure sequence. Emphasis is put on the need for the Aircraft Operator to integrate 
his own strategy to compute a TOBT related to the flight. Following the receipt of the TOBT, 
the ATC system will calculate and provide the Estimated Taxi-Out Time (EXOT) based on 
the predicted traffic load, gate / stand location, runway in use, and waiting period at the 
Holding Position, etc. 

The flight is introduced into the pre-departure sequence. The Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler, in coordination with the aircrew, can manage the turn-round process accordingly.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Opera-
tions is informed when the TTOT changes by more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check should be performed at a predefined time (local parameter) to confirm TOBT 
prior to TSAT issue and verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan estimates given the updated 
TOBT. A TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations is informed on updated 
TTOT. 

This Milestone Process is actually constantly applicable in the CDM Platform, as soon as 
a TOBT is available. However the confirmed TOBT prior to TSAT has special status, where 
AO/GH check the quality of TOBT before TSAT issue. 

Operational Status 
(changes to) IN-BLOCK

Action on CDM This process is triggered by   	n  a new TOBT or TTOT update. No need to confirm an 
Operation (ACISP)      existing TOBT if it has been manually modified before.



MILESTONE 10 TSAT Issued	

Definition The time ATC issues the Target Start Up Approval Time

Origin and priority ATC

Timing The information is provided t-minutes before EOBT, where t is a parameter agreed locally

Data Quality Accuracy is agreed locally.

Effect The flight is stabilised into the pre-departure sequence. The Aircraft Operator/ 
Ground Handler, in coordination with the aircrew, can manage the turn-round process 
accordingly.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant partners of the TSAT that has been allocated to the flight. 
The Network Operations is informed by a T-DPI-s for non regulated flights.

Second step: To check whether the number of TOBT updates exceeds a tolerance defined 
locally, after TSAT has been issued.

First: The TSAT will indicate to the partners the time when the start up approval can be 
expected. Network Operations will be informed with a T-DPI-s for non regulated flights. No 
check is performed.

Second: A check shall be performed to see the number of TOBT updates after TSAT has 
been issued. In case the number of TOBT updates exceeds a threshold, then the TOBT 
input should be processed according to local procedure. 

This process is triggered by 
n	 A defined time (local parameter) before TOBT
n	 TOBT update after TSAT issue

MILESTONE 11 Boarding Starts	

Definition The gate is open for passengers to physically start boarding (independent of whether 
boarding takes place via an air-bridge/pier, aircraft steps or coaching to a stand).

This is not to be confused with the time passengers are pre-called to the gate via flight 
information display systems (FIDS) or public address systems.

Origin and priority Automatic from airport system or manual input by Aircraft Operator/ Ground Handler.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect When boarding commences it gives the Airport CDM Partners a good indication of 
whether the TOBT/TSAT will be respected.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Start Boarding Time 
(ASBT). 

Second step: To check whether boarding starts in time to respect TOBT and inform the 
AO/GH in case TOBT needs to be updated.

Inform of Actual Start Boarding Time (ASBT) when it occurs. At a certain time before 
TOBT (local variable e.g. corresponding to aircraft type) a check shall be performed to 
check the boarding status.

This process is triggered by

Origin and priority Provided by the Aircraft Operator/ Ground Handler.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is directly available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect ATC refines the pre-departure sequence. The pilot requests start up just before TSAT, 
following coordination with the Ground Handler. (Dispatcher / Supervisor / Redcap).

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Ready Time (ARDT) in 
the Airport CDM Platform and that the aircraft is ready for start up / push-back.

Second step: To inform the AO/GH that TOBT has passed and the Airport CDM Platform 
has not yet received ARDT or Ready Status (RDY).

Inform of ARDT or RDY confirming that the flight follows the indicated TOBT. At TOBT 
+ tolerance the AO/GH are informed that TOBT has passed and there has not been a
ready status message yet.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect ATC confirms TSAT to the pilot in order to maintain the aircraft in the pre-departure se-
quence. Provided the aircraft was ready on time (ARDT), it is now up to ATC to assure 
that a regulated flight can respect its CTOT.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Start up Request Time 
(ASRT) in the Airport CDM Platform.

Second step: to alert all relevant Airport CDM Partners when no start up has been re-
quested inside the locally agreed TSAT tolerance window.

Inform of ASRT when it occurs. If the start up request is not made by TSAT + tolerance, 
the AO/GH is informed that no start up has been requested, and should update TOBT.

MILESTONE 15 Off-Block

Definition AOBT – Actual Off-Block Time. The time the aircraft pushes back/vacates the parking 
position (Equivalent to Airline/Handler ATD – Actual Time of Departure ACARS=OUT).

Origin and priority ACARS equipped aircraft or automated docking systems or ATC systems 
(e.g. A-SMGCS) or by manual input.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect TTOT updated considering the EXOT.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Off-Block Time (AOBT) 
in the Airport CDM Platform and that the aircraft has commenced push-back / taxi from 
parking position. 

Second step: To check if TTOT changes by more than the agreed tolerance and inform 
Network Operations.

Inform of AOBT when it occurs. AOBT always triggers an A-DPI message to Network 
Operations or in the case of remote holding at a defined time prior to TTOT. After a first 
A-DPI is sent this check shall be performed to check TTOT updates against the TTOT
tolerance before Network Operations is informed, with a new A-DPI, of the updated
