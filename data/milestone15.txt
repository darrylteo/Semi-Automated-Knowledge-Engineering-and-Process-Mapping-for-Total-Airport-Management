MILESTONE 15 Off-Block

Definition AOBT – Actual Off-Block Time. The time the aircraft pushes back/vacates the parking 
position (Equivalent to Airline/Handler ATD – Actual Time of Departure ACARS=OUT).

Origin and priority ACARS equipped aircraft or automated docking systems or ATC systems 
(e.g. A-SMGCS) or by manual input.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect TTOT updated considering the EXOT.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Off-Block Time (AOBT) 
in the Airport CDM Platform and that the aircraft has commenced push-back / taxi from 
parking position. 

Second step: To check if TTOT changes by more than the agreed tolerance and inform 
Network Operations.

Inform of AOBT when it occurs. AOBT always triggers an A-DPI message to Network 
Operations or in the case of remote holding at a defined time prior to TTOT. After a first 
A-DPI is sent this check shall be performed to check TTOT updates against the TTOT
tolerance before Network Operations is informed, with a new A-DPI, of the updated
TTOT.

This process is triggered by AOBT detection.
