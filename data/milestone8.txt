Definition Commence of Ground Handling Operations (ACGT).

Note: this milestone is specific to flights that are the first operation of the day or that have 
been long term parked. For flights that are on a normal turn-round ACGT is considered 
to commence at AIBT.

Origin and priority Aircraft Operator / Ground Handler will provide the information.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect The occurrence of ACGT triggers an update of downstream estimates:
TOBT is updated automatically or inserted manually by the Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler, calculated on the basis of the estimated turn-round period for the departing 
flight.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Op-
erations is informed when the TTOT changes by more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the updat-
ed TOBT or ATC Flight Plan. A TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations 
is informed on updated TTOT.
