MILESTONE 3 Take Off from Outstation

Definition The ATOT from the outstation (ADEP)

Origin and priority The outstation provides ATOT to the Network Operations and Aircraft Operator.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality The accuracy of ATOT is +/- 1 minute.

Effect If the departure airport is more than 3hrs flying time from the destination airport the ATOT 
is received from either the Network Operations FUM or via the Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler. Using the ATOT an ELDT can be calculated by using the Estimated Elapsed Time 
on the FPL. 

If the flight is within 3hrs flying time of the destination airport the Network Operations moni-
tors progress of the flight using the ETFMS and send a Flight Update Message (FUM) that 
provides updates of the flight’s progress. 

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH estimated landing time after take off from outstation are con-
sistent with the outbound ATC Flight Plan, and when needed inform the Network Operations 
about the updated take off time estimates using a T-DPI-t Message. 

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan at take off from outsta-
tion. A TTOT tolerance of 5 minutes is respected before Network Operations is informed of 
the updated TTOT. Calculation basis for the TTOT shall take into account EIBT+MTTT+EXOT. 
In case EOBT is later than EIBT+MTTT, TTOT equals EOBT+EXOT. In the case where 
TOBT is available this prediction will overrule the EIBT+MTTT estimate, hence TTOT equals 
TOBT+EXOT.

This process is triggered by
n    the take off from outstation.
