MILESTONE 13	 Start Up Requested

Definition The time that start up is requested (ASRT).

Origin and priority ATC (based on pilot request).

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect ATC confirms TSAT to the pilot in order to maintain the aircraft in the pre-departure se-
quence. Provided the aircraft was ready on time (ARDT), it is now up to ATC to assure 
that a regulated flight can respect its CTOT.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Start up Request Time 
(ASRT) in the Airport CDM Platform.

Second step: to alert all relevant Airport CDM Partners when no start up has been re-
quested inside the locally agreed TSAT tolerance window.

Inform of ASRT when it occurs. If the start up request is not made by TSAT + tolerance, 
the AO/GH is informed that no start up has been requested, and should update TOBT.

Timestamp when the tolerance window has passed at TSAT.
