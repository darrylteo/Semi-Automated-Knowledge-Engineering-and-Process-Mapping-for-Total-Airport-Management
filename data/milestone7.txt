MILESTONE 7 In-Block	

Definition AIBT - Actual In-Block Time. This is the time that an aircraft arrives in-blocks.
(Equivalent to Airline/Handler ATA – Actual Time of Arrival, ACARS = IN)

Note: ACGT is considered to commence at AIBT

Origin and priority ACARS equipped aircraft or automated docking systems or ATC systems 
(e.g. A-SMGCS) or by manual input.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect The occurrence of AIBT should trigger an update of downstream estimates: TOBT and 
TTOT are updated automatically or inserted manually by the Aircraft Operator / Ground 
Handler, calculated on the basis of the estimated turn-round period for the departing 
flight.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Op-
erations is informed when the TTOT changes by more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the updat-
ed TOBT or ATC Flight Plan. A TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations 
is informed on updated TTOT.

This process is triggered by
