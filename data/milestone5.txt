MILESTONE 5 Final Approach	

Definition The flight enters the Final Approach phase at the destination airport.

Origin and priority This information is normally available from ATC. The radar system detects a flight based 
upon the assigned SSR code and identifies when the flight crosses either a defined 
range / position or passes/leaves a predetermined level.

Timing Dependent upon local parameters that are defined by ATC.

Data Quality Must be equal to the accuracy of the ATC system.

Effect Update of the ELDT to determine a new TOBT. When a flight reaches this stage it is usu-
ally between 2 and 5 minutes from landing (depending on the parameter set by ATC). 
This is often the prompt for many partners to start moving resources connected with the 
flight, such as positioning a parking marshal and ground handling services.

Procedures To commence the TOBT process and check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent 
with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Operations is informed when the TTOT changes by 
more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the up-
dated TOBT. The TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations is informed 
of updated TTOT.

This process is triggered by
n    the detection of the flight by radar in either FIR, TMA, or on Final Approach.
