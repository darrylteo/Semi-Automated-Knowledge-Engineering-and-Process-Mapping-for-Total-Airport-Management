MILESTONE 6 Landed

Definition ALDT – Actual Landing Time. This is the time that an aircraft touches down on a runway. 
(Equivalent to ATC ATA – Actual Time of Arrival landing, ACARS=ON).

Origin and priority Provided by ATC system or by ACARS from equipped aircraft.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect The occurrence of ALDT triggers an update of downstream estimates: TOBT and TTOT 
are updated automatically or inserted manually by the Aircraft Operator / Ground Han-
dler, calculated on the basis of the defined turn-round period for the departing flight.

The EIBT can be updated according to the ALDT +EXIT.

Procedures To check whether the AO/GH TOBT is consistent with the ATC Flight Plan. Network Op-
erations is informed when the TTOT changes by more than the agreed TTOT tolerance.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan given the updat-
ed TOBT or ATC Flight Plan. A TTOT tolerance is respected before Network Operations 
is informed on updated TTOT.

This process is triggered by
