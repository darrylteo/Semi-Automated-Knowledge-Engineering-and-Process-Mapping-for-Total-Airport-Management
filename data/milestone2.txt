MILESTONE 2 EOBT - 2 hr

Definition At EOBT-2 hr most flights will be known in the Airport CDM Platform including if they are regu-
lated or not. All regulated flights receive a CTOT from Network Operations.

Origin and priority The CTOT is issued by the Network Operations and is sent to relevant ATS units as well as the 
departure aerodrome. CTOT flights usually have a priority over unregulated flights.

Timing If the flight is regulated, a CTOT is issued at EOBT–2h.	

Data Quality Not applicable.

Effect For inbound flights, ELDT is updated based on information provided by the FUM messages, 
taking into account the actual progress of the flight. 					

Procedures To check (before or after take off from outstation) whether AO/GH flight estimates are consist-
ent with the ATC Flight Plan and to inform Network Operations about the updated take off 
time estimate, using a T-DPI Message.

This check shall be performed to verify feasibility of the ATC Flight Plan estimated off block 
time at EOBT-2 hrs. At EOBT-2 hrs Network Operations is informed through the first T-DPI 
message. Calculation basis for the TTOT shall take into account EIBT+MTTT+EXOT, if lat-
er than EOBT+EXOT. In the case of manual input of TOBT, this estimate will override the 
EIBT+MTTT estimate, hence TTOT equals TOBT+EXOT.

This procedure is triggered by 
n     a time stamp, at EOBT – 2h.
