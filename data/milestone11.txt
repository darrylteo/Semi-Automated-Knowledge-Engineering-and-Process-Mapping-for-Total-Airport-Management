MILESTONE 11 Boarding Starts	

Definition The gate is open for passengers to physically start boarding (independent of whether 
boarding takes place via an air-bridge/pier, aircraft steps or coaching to a stand).

This is not to be confused with the time passengers are pre-called to the gate via flight 
information display systems (FIDS) or public address systems.

Origin and priority Automatic from airport system or manual input by Aircraft Operator/ Ground Handler.

Timing The information is directly available after occurrence of the milestone.

Data Quality Data is available with an accuracy of +/- 1 minute.

Effect When boarding commences it gives the Airport CDM Partners a good indication of 
whether the TOBT/TSAT will be respected.

Procedures First step: To inform all relevant Airport CDM Partners of Actual Start Boarding Time 
(ASBT). 

Second step: To check whether boarding starts in time to respect TOBT and inform the 
AO/GH in case TOBT needs to be updated.

Inform of Actual Start Boarding Time (ASBT) when it occurs. At a certain time before 
TOBT (local variable e.g. corresponding to aircraft type) a check shall be performed to 
check the boarding status.

This process is triggered by
n   a time variable <value> minutes before TOBT.
