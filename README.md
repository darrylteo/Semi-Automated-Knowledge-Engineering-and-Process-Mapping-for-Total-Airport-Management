# Semi-Automated Knowledge Engineering and Process Mapping for Total Airport Management

This repository provides a framework for **scaffolded symbolic fusion**, bridging the gap between unstructured aviation documentation and machine-readable Knowledge Graphs (KGs). By leveraging expert-curated ontological structures to guide Large Language Model (LLM) extraction, this pipeline enables the automated synthesis of domain-grounded operational models with high semantic fidelity and verifiable data provenance.

---
## Workflow Overview
The pipeline transitions from unstructured technical corpora to deterministic process models through three primary stages:
1.  **Schema-Guided Extraction**: Utilizing the `LangExtract` library to perform document-level inference constrained by formal class hierarchies and expert-curated KGs.
2.  **Symbolic Synthesis**: Mapping extracted semantic triples into an OWL formatted KG.
3.  **Process Visualization**: Automated derivation of standardized swimlane diagrams from the synthesized KG for operational validation and stakeholder alignment.

## Repository Structure
### `./data/`
Contains the source documentation and text conversions used for extraction.
* `milestones.pdf`: The original source document (Eurocontrol A-CDM manual).
* `milestones.txt`: The full source document converted from PDF to text via [PDF24](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/pdf-to-txt).
* `milestone{i}.txt`: Segmented text files used for modular processing.
* `extracted_triples_{i}.csv`: Raw semantic triples generated by the LLM. Includes columns for **data provenance** (traceable references) and expert-validated ground truth (`Good` column).

### `./results/`
Contains the output of the extraction process.
* `aviation_KG.owl`: The constructed KG. Best viewed and edited using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
* `airport_swimlanes.drawio`: The swimlane diagrams derived from the KG. Best viewed via [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
* 
### `./src/`
* `get_triples_lang.py` The main extraction engine that implements KG guided prompts extraction to ensure structural determinism and symbolic fusion. Page-level implementation is provided. Requires an LLM API key to run code.
* `triples_to_KG_and_swimlanes.py`: Python script to deterministically formalize knowledge triples into a knowlegde graph (.owl format) and generate swimlane diagrams (.drawio format).
* `utils/`: Helper functions.
